My partner and me disagreed about what to do with this software.

I believed that we should delete it that no one should have it as this software could ruin lives.

In the hands of terrorists or other dangerous people it could bring death and despair.

My partner felt that it was none of our business what happened to others and that we deserved a 
payday for all of our efforts.

All that mattered to him was that we could be millionaires if we sold it.
