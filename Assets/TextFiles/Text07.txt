I couldn’t take the risk, so I started to remove all traces of the software and my partner freaked 
out he tried to stop me.

We got into a fight and he started hitting me so in a panic I grabbed the keyboard and started 
hitting him back.

I just kept hitting him and hitting him till he stopped moving.

When I calmed down I realized what I had just done and tried to help him, but it was too late. I 
had killed somebody.
