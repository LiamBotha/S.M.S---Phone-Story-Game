As I got older and more into programming I found myself even more isolated from others.

My only forms of communication being with people on forums and boards that I browse and the 
delivery guys that bring me my food and packages.

So, when a guy approached me for help with a concept he was working on I was all too willing to 
help.

I look back on this as one of the biggest mistakes in my life.
